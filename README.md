This main branch is the completed textual vertion of the board game Parcheesi

To play the game you have to run the text_Parcheesi.py file

Description:
  -The user will be prompted to say how many players will be playing (from 2 to 4)
  -Afterwards the first player has to roll their dices.
  -If the current player doesn't have any pieces on the path, they can only spawn if one of the dices has a 5.
  -If they have atleast 1 piece on the path they have to indicate that they want to move the piece with each die.
  -If one of the dices lands on 5 again, they can chose whether they want to spawn a new piece or if they want to move
    one that is already on the path.
  -If the player has all his pieces on the path, they can only move.
  -In the case that one player lands on the spot of another player, the other player's piece will be sent to it's start
    and has to be spawned again.
  -During every turn each player will be given their stats so they can decide whether what to do in their turn
  -If the players get bored, they can quit the game by entering 'q' at the start of their turn. (they will be prompted)
